  "I live in Iran and I have been using Tor for censorship circumvention. During political unrest while the government tightens grip on other censorship circumvention alternatives, Tor with obfuscation plugins remain the only solution. Tor changed my personal life in many ways. It made it possible to access information on Youtube, Twitter, Blogger and countless other sites. I am grateful of Tor project, people working on it as well as people running Tor nodes.": {

Many people confuse our movement with trying to bring Britain back or something like that. It's never been about Britain or China per se, it's about being able to decide our own future instead of being ruled by autocrats from a far off city.\n\n\nI have heard of others in my place who are now under investigation or possibly facing jail time, this isn't a risk I can take. Thank you, Tor Project. There are certainly improvements to be made with the Bundle, such as its JavaScript settings, Punycode, etc. but without it my life might've been over by now. Thanks.": {

I use tor for telegram, accessing social medias and most of all be anonymous! tor helped me in Censorship circumvention, Political organizing(view and comment my ideas without fear!), Coping with domestic abuse or stalking(in Iran it is our ISP's), Curtailing surveillance(again from our regime), Whistleblowing or anti-corruption reporting(our gun is our mobiles and social medias). and beside tor for us is more than keep our privacy! When regime tries to block all anti filters, tor is the only tool to connecting social medias and free internet. and also there were times that tor was blocked and I used bridges with email robot to connecting tor. At the end tor worked for me 98% success and for other 2% I used email robot(bridges). and also I use tor proxy as tor browser(50% proxy and 50% browser)! We(all Iranians) thank you for tor.\n": {
